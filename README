This plugin remembers all the blocks that you place, and wont let
any other player directly remove those plocks.  However, they may
remove them with fire, lava, tnt, creepers, etc.

If OwnBlocks does not find the config file ('plugins/OwnBlocks/OwnBlocks.properties')
then the latest example, or default, config file will be created with the correct name.
This means that you may back and move up your current config file, then restart your server
to get the latest default config file with descriptions of all the available settings.
